# Jaccard

Jaccard Similarity is used to measure how similar two sets are — perfect for identifying overlapping product purchases among customers.

I've provided a Python code snippet that involves data manipulation and calculations using the pandas library. This code is aimed at calculating the Jaccard similarity between pairs of customers based on their purchased products and finding the pair of customers with the highest Jaccard similarity.

The code reads a CSV file containing customer-product data, calculates the Jaccard similarity between each pair of customers, and then identifies the pair with the highest Jaccard similarity.

📁 Problem Statement:
Given a dataset of customers and the products they have purchased, we aim to:

Calculate pairwise Jaccard similarity between customers.

Identify customers with high purchase overlap.

Use results to support product recommendation systems.

📌 Applications:
🛍️ Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior

🔍 Collaborative filtering for recommendations

📉 Reducing churn by identifying similar user patterns

✨ Future Improvements:
Add Cosine Similarity for comparison

Visualize similarity matrix using heatmaps

Build a recommender system demo
